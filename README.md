<h2>This project focuses on building a functional 3D game where players can:</h2>
<li>Interact with objects scattered in a central game area.</li>
<li>Drag and drop these objects to a circular placement area at the bottom of the screen using a mouse or touch input.</li>
<h2>Currently, the game includes: </h2>
<ul><li>A central game area.</li>
<li>A placement area designed for object organization.</li>
<li>A few draggable 3D objects that players can pick up and drop within the scene.</li>
<li>An 8-ball asset added for enhanced gameplay aesthetics.</li>
<li>A respawn system that resets objects back to the center if they fall outside the playable area.</li>
<li>A lift-and-drag mechanic, where selected objects are lifted slightly upwards for better visibility and control during interaction.</li></ul>
