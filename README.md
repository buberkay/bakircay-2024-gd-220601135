<h2>This project focuses on building a functional 3D game where players can:</h2>
<li>Interact with objects scattered in a central game area.</li>
<li>Drag and drop these objects to a circular placement area at the bottom of the screen using a mouse or touch input.</li>

<h2>Currently, the game includes: </h2>
<ul><li>A central game area.</li>
<li>A placement area designed for object organization, where players must match objects correctly. If an object is not placed correctly, it is forced to jump back to its starting position, encouraging correct placement.</li>
<li>Draggable 3D objects that players can pick up and drop within the scene.</li>
<li>An 8-ball asset added for enhanced gameplay aesthetics.</li>
<li>A reset button where players can reset the object locations.</li>
<li>A lift-and-drag mechanic, where selected objects are lifted slightly upwards for better visibility and control during interaction.</li>
</ul>

<h2>New update: Skills! </h2>
    <ul>
      The project now has 2 skills which extends the fun for players!
      <li><b>Jump Skill:</b> Players can make the objects jump for extra level of interaction and excitement to object manipulation.</li>
      <li><b>Freeze Skill:</b> Players can freeze objects in place temporarily, helping with the organization and placement of objects in the scene.</li>
    </ul>
